# Mondrian-solver
•developed a comprehensive state-space solution for the Mondrian tiling problem, employing both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Iterative-Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) techniques. The process begins with an initial square of size a×a and explores possible configurations up to a specified depth M.
•The core actions within this approach involve merging or splitting rectangles. This process is meticulously designed with rigorous state-space refinement to exclude congruent states, ensuring that computational resources are used efficiently. A hashing function plays a crucial role in this refinement, allowing for quick identification and exclusion of equivalent states.
•Implemented a parallelized BFS approach, significantly enhancing the speed of exploration to optimize performance.Additionally, a memory-efficient variant of IDDFS(Iterative-Deepening Depth-First Search) was developed, adapting strategies dynamically based on the complexity of the state space. This approach ensures that the solution remains efficient and effective, even as the problem's complexity increases.
